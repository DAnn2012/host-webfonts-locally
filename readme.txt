With only 2 clicks of a button, CAOS for Webfonts automagically downloads your Google Fonts you want to WordPress' content-folder, generates a stylesheet for it and enqueues it in your theme's header.

== Description ==

CAOS for Webfonts is written with performance in mind. Other plugins make repeated requests to your Blog's database to replace/remove requests to external Webfonts source (e.g. Google Fonts) on-the-fly. This might be user-friendly, but it's a performance killer, because locally hosting your Google Webfonts should be a set-and-forget feature. The source of your webfonts should be replaced once and kept that way.

That's why I kept CAOS for Webfonts small and useful. It uses the Google Fonts Helper API to automagically download the fonts you want to WordPress' contents folder and generate a stylesheet for it. The stylesheet is automatically included to your site's header and 100% compatible with plugins like Autoptimize or W3 Total Cache. After that, all you need to do is remove any mention of requests to external webfont sources (using e.g. a child theme) and you're done!

This will *decrease your pageload times*, *leverage browser cache*, *minimize DNS requests* and effectively bring you a perfect score on *Pagespeed Insights* and *Pingdom*, without taking toll on the performance of your webserver.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/host-webfonts-local` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Use the Settings -> Optimize Webfonts screen to configure the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How come my font isn't available in CAOS for Webfonts? =

This could be for several reasons:
1. Have you checked if your font is available on Google Fonts?
1. Is your font listed as an open source font, or is it a premium font? For obvious reasons, CAOS for Webfonts only has access to open source fonts.
